D_mel_transposon_sequence_set.fa
-----------------------------------

This file was used in [Sackton et al (2009)](http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/1/449.full)
and was created by modifying the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project's TE data set (v9.4.1) to 

1) include the class/subclass of each family, and
2) remove any TE sequences not from D. melanogaster. 

There are 128 records in this file: 125 TE families, plus the rDNA, SAR_DM and XDMR repeats. This file is formatted to allow RepeatMasker to generate a .tbl file using the -lib option. LTR elements are represented by a single record (i.e. LTRs are joined to internal regions).
